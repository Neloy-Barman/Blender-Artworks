# Coloring Objects

* To give color to an object, select the **object**, go to **Material Properties**, create new **Material** and assign the chosen color to the object.
* If you have multiple objects, and you want to assign the same color from a partiular object, then Select the colorless objects and the colored object in last, then press **Ctrl+L** and select **Link Materials** to color the other objects.
* To create a same color in different shades, you can duplicate color from **Add New Material** and change other properties based on preferences.
* If you want a color to emit, then change the **Surface** to **Emission** shader and change the shader strength according to need.
