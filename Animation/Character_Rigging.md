* Make sure the **Rigify** add-on is enabled.
* **Addition of the armature: -** Press **Shift+A**. Now Click on **Armature -> Single Bone**. This will add an armature.  
* **Front view bone: -** To view the bone always in front of the mesh, go to **Object Data Properties** from **Properties** panel. Go to **Viewport Display** and enable **In Front**.
* **Modes: -** The bone has 3 modes, **Object, Edit & Pose mode**. We can animate bone in the pose mode.
* **Display Mode: -** Go to **Viewport Display**, Change the dropdown from **Display As**.
    * **B-Bone:** We can change the size of the bone according to need in this type. **Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S** will change the size of the bone but will not affect where the bone is placed. It will be easier to select important or other bones based on the size.
* **Extrude Bone: -** In **Edit mode**, take a **head** and press **E** to create an extruded part.
* **Rename Bone: -** Click on **Bone Properties** from **Properties**. There we can change the name of the bone.
