# Lighting

## Base Area Light
* An area light opposed to the camera makes the scene look better.
* Move the **Area** light to up. Then rotate on the **X-axis: -45''** and **Z-axis:45''**. Now the light will be perfectly opposite of the camera.  
* Change the **Color** and increase the **Power** of the light to satisfaction.

## World Light
* Go to **World Properties**.
* There you can set the **Color** of the **Background**.
* Also you can change the **Strength**. But better is set at **Default** value.
* In the **Volume**, we can do some fog effects in the scene by changing it to **Volume Scatter**. But it's better to do this using a **Cube**, because we have a better control over density.
