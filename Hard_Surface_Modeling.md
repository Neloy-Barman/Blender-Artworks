# Hard Surface Modeling

There is a free course for modeling realistic and cool things. Find it <a href="https://www.blenderbros.com/jumpstart">here</a>. Just create an account there and move accordingly with the video. You will get the video link for the course within the mail.

* Go to Viewport Shading from upper panel. Enable **Cavity** to get a clear view of the sharp edges.
* We can enable **Shadow** also for proper view purpose. But it may cause performance issues for the hardware things. 
* Enable **Face Orientation** to get to know the inside and outside faces.      
* Click on **Status Bar** and enable **Scene Statistics**. It will show counts of verts, faces and others. 


## Things to keep in mind
* It's better to work in side-view. Go to the **Right** view from the pie menu. Then the side view hits the Y-axis perpendicularly. Lot of tools such as hard-ops works better in the Y-axis. So, it's recommended to use **Right** view as the side-view to start modeling. 
* Whenver we scale something on any axis, we always need to reset scaling to 1 using **Ctrl+A**. Otherwise problems get created when applying beveling because the scaling gets off-balanced.
* If use add-ons like **Box-cutter**, it adds scale reset automatically when we start using cutters and we don't have to reset manually. 
* When we work with the orthographic view, we don't need to specify the axis, it's rotated along the axis we are looking at.





* When we want to create a cut on the object of a particular shape, we will select the cutter shape and the object pressing **Shift**. Then press **Ctrl+-** to apply bool tool and cut the object. It applies the boolean modifier automatically. To use this we have to enable the **Bool Tool** add-on from preferences.  
* The object we use as cutters can be moved to seperate collection, so that when the work is done we can turn them off for hassle free work.
