# Fundamentals of Realistic Modeling

## References
* Find the **Front, Top, Back, Side** views of the object and the object in **Textured**. It's essential to find proper references of the object you will be modeling. Otherwise when you start and go on, you won't be able to proceed and get frustated leaving the project completion.
* Go for the **Branded Object**. In most of the cases, there will be proper blueprints searching for the object with name.
* Place the blueprints properly on the blender.
