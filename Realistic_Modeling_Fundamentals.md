# Fundamentals of Realistic Modeling

## References
* Find the **Front, Top, Back, Side** views of the object and the object in **Textured**. It's essential to find proper references of the object you will be modeling. Otherwise when you start and go on, you won't be able to proceed and get frustated leaving the project completion.
* Go for the **Branded Object**. In most of the cases, there will be proper blueprints searching for the object with name.
* Place the blueprints properly on the blender.

## 3 common ways to fix something
* Re-calculate normals
* Merge vertices **By Distance** using **M**.
* Check there are no extra inside **Edges** or **Faces** creating problems.

## Random things to consider 
* In the real worlds, surfaces don't actually intersect. There is a very shuttle gap in between them.
* The gap might not be visible to the eye, but that might add shadows creating more realism to the scene. That's why we need to keep sharp edges. In those cases, selecting the edges, we can perform **Edge Creasing**.
