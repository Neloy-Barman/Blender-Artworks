# Helpful External Addons

## Resource Link
* Find all the required external addons in this [website](https://gfxfather.com/) for free.

## Installing Addons
* Go to **Edit->Preferences**
* Select **Add-ons** from the left side bar.
* Now select **Install** from the upper panel.
* Locate the **zipped** file but make sure it contains only the required code files. Otherwise it won't be installed.
* Select **Install Add-on** and it will be installed.
* Then you can **Refresh** or restart the software and search for the add-on. It will be found.

## MACHIN3tools (Paid)
* Enable **Smart Vert, Smart Face, CleanUp, Focus** from tools. These are really important.
* Enable **Modes Pie, Save Pie, Shading Pie, Views Pie, Alignments Pies, Cursor and Origin Pie** from Pie Menus.
* You can check or change the key bindings from **Keymaps**.
* You need to disable **Toggle Cavity** from Modes Pie because it will switch cavity based on modes and that's irritating.
* The **Tab** menu is overwritten. 
    * When we press in **Object** mode, the pie menu contains: **Edit, Vertex, Edge, Face**. We can directly move to these modes from **Object** mode.
    * Pressing in **Edit or others** mode, it provides **Object mode and others**.
        * Also provides **Occlude mode** which is the X-Ray mode.
        * **Auto Merge** which merges vertices while close to each other. In vanilla blender, it takes quite a few steps to enable this feature.
* **Shift+S** This is the same thing as in the vanilla blender just coming in a pie menu. You can set origin and cursor according to need.
