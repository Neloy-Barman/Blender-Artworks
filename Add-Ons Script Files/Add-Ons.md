# Add-Ons

## Archimesh
* This add-on allows to add things like door, window, shelves and many decoration props such as books, lamp.
* Press **Shift+A**->**Mesh**->**Archimesh** and the props you want.
* These are very useful when you want to fill in a room with objects but don't want to model them from scratch. 


## Node Wrangler
* It's a set of utilities. It's a bunch of shortcuts that help us to manage nodes in **Shading** nodes panel.
* For example, if you need to add **Texture Coordinate, Mapping** then place the cursor on the **Color** node, press **Ctrl+T**. The nodes with proper connection will appear then.
* View **Node Wrangler** documentation for more shortcuts.


## IsoCam 
* Install **Isocam_Script.py** in add-ons.
* Then enable **Create IsoCam** from the add-ons.
* Then Pressing **N** in the viewport will give you option named **PR Isocam**.
