# Shading
* Go to **Shading** from the top panel.
* From the right top panel, go to **Viewport Shading**, enable **Scene Lights**.
* You can choose any **HDR** option to suit the best one according to you. 
* Rotate the scene to get better lighting and the shadows of the objects.
* Adding **Material** to the object will create a node in the lower panel. This node represents the material properties. whatever we do in the materials can be done easily within the nodes also.
* We can also add new nodes by pressing **Shift+A** in the lower panel and choose the desired node.
* To connect nodes, select the nodes pressing **Shift** and press **F**. The nodes are connected then.
* Principal BSDf -> Principal Bi-directional Scalaring Distributional Function. It's a mathmatical algorithm to caculate light emission in the shader. Bi-directional means it deals with both reflected and absorbed light.
