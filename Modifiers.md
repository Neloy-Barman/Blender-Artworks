# Modifiers


### Array
**We can create same object multiple times. Set fixed count number and tweak the values of dimensions according to need. Such as, Stairs steps.**

### Boolean
**We can intersect, combine and subtract portions among objects.**

### Curve
**Selecting an object, we can merge it into the bazier curve. Then the geometry will be presented according to the curve properties.**

### Displace
**We manipulate an object with different textures by applying and tweaking the properties values.**

### Skin
**Creating a custom geometry, we can give it a skin or volume. To change the thikness of the skin, you have to turn on vertex selection mode, then pressing Ctrl+A, we can scale the skin. For example we can create railings, custom trees using this modifier.**

### Wireframe
**This modifier is similar to skin modifier. But applyig this one, we can give metalic vibe to the object. Such as, rod stairs, metalic frames.**

### Solidify
**This gives a proper volume to the geometry. For example, giving volume to the buidling, leafs, car body and many more.**
