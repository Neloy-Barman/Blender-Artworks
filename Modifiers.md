# Modifiers


### Array
**We can create same object multiple times. Set fixed count number and tweak the values of dimensions according to need. Such as, Stairs steps.**

### Boolean
**We can intersect, combine and subtract portions among objects.**

### Curve
**Selecting an object, we can merge it into the bazier curve. Then the geometry will be presented according to the curve properties.**

### Displace
**We manipulate an object with different textures by applying and tweaking the properties values.**

### Skin
**Creating a custom geometry, we can give it a skin or volume. To change the thikness of the skin, you have to turn on vertex selection mode, then pressing Ctrl+A, we can scale the skin. For example we can create railings, custom trees using this modifier.**

### Wireframe
**This modifier is similar to skin modifier. But applyig this one, we can give metalic vibe to the object. Such as, rod stairs, metalic frames.**

### Solidify
**This gives a proper volume to the geometry. For example, giving volume to the buidling, leafs, car body and many more.**

### Mirror
**This is the perfect modifier to give symmetrical vibe to anything. The cursor should be in the middle of the mirror objects. When you extrude things from one side, the for some cases they overlap. That's why You should use clipping to merge them properly.**


### Subdivision Surface
**The algorithm sub-divides our geometry non-destructively. Increasing the Render number in the modifier gives us the best results. If we want to control the geometry, then we have to add some more loopcuts to get a better result. It almost works like bazier curves.To get sharper and smoother corner, add loopcuts from all ways.**


### Bevel
**Does the same thing as the Bevel using Ctrl+B. But it applies beveling on the whole object and all the edges.**
