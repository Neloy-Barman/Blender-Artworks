# World Texture
* Go to **World** from **Properties**.
* Click on **Color** and select **Environment Texture**. Now the whole scene will be filled with pink color. It's because we need to upload a **HDRI Texture** image.
* Now click on **Open Image** from **Browse Images to be linked**. Select the image from device and the whole scene will be added with HDRI lighting.
* But we want the texture lighting only, roaming within the viewport may get distracted because of the image. So, we need to turn off the image view.
* Go to **Render** from **Properties**.
* Click on **Film** and enable **Transparent**. This will turn off the image, but the lighting is on.
